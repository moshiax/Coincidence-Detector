The (((Coincidence Detector))) is a browser extension for Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Opera that uses word replacement to (((echo))) Jewish names.  It was originally written by @Cuckington, and it has since been improved upon by @Perception and friends.

### Features

1. Obviously the primary feature is to detect (((names))) so you and your friends get a constant reminder of what total coincidences have occurred in the past, and continue to occur today.
2. Echo Factor: Now you can customize the number of parentheses. Is (((3))) too Jewy? Try ((2)).
3. Disable Function: Echoes causing a headache? Disable for the site you're on. Don't know why you'd ever do that though.
4. REFRESH LIST: This is the most important update. The extension now calls to a (((J)))List managed by a few of us goys. To see the new additions echo properly, hit Refresh List!
5. **[Judas Watch Integration](https://judas.watch/)**:  Get more info on traitors that exist in both our (((list))) and the Judas Watch database.
6. Tree Algorithm:  it makes the detector faster.  (Thanks to @Saturn)
7. Match Single Words:  Those who don't like matching only on surnames can disable this for more accuracy.
8. Case Sensitivity:  The Norwegian word for "stone" is "stein".  If that being echoed upsets you, turn on case sensitivity.  That way only "Stein" with a capital "S" will be echoed.
